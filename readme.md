# Data Modeling Project: Snowflake to Databricks Migration

## Overview

As a client embarked on the journey from Snowflake to Databricks, there arose the critical need to reimagine the data landscape. This project involved restructuring sales tables and ensuring a seamless transition by effectively translating data from Snowflake to Databricks. The overarching goal was to optimize the migration process while maintaining data integrity and accuracy throughout.

## Project Scope and Objectives

The primary objective of this project was to facilitate the migration of data from Snowflake to Databricks. This involved:

- **Data Transformation**: Restructuring and transforming existing sales tables to align with the new Databricks environment.
- **Migration Strategy**: Developing a strategy to migrate data seamlessly while minimizing downtime and ensuring no loss of critical information.
- **Optimization**: Enhancing data processing capabilities and optimizing query performance in the Databricks environment.

## Stakeholder Involvement

Throughout the project, several stakeholder meetings were conducted to ensure that the data modeling and migration met the expectations of various sectors within the organization. Accessibility and understanding for analysis were key considerations, allowing different departments to effectively utilize the data.

## Privacy Considerations

Privacy has been carefully considered throughout this project. Fictitious names and data obfuscation techniques have been employed to protect the proprietary nature of the data. These changes are implemented in a manner that in no way compromises the functioning of the project or undermines any aspect of its integrity.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Modeling**: Includes scripts and processes for restructuring sales data from Snowflake to fit Databricks schemas.
- **SQL Files**: Contains SQL scripts for creating tables, views, and performing data transformations.
- **Documentation**: Includes project documentation, data dictionaries, and README files.
- **Tests**: Ensures data quality and integrity post-transformation.
