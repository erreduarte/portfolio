    This YAML file provides an explanation of the SQL code that combines data
    from ecommerce and subscriptions orders.
  steps:
    - step: 1
      description: >
        Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `ecommerce_orders` that retrieves
        customer information from the `ecommerce_customers` table.
      details:
        - name: ecommerce_orders
          purpose: >
            Extracts customer details such as ID, email, and address information (zip code,
            street, city, country) from the `ecommerce_customers` table using JSON functions.
          fields_extracted:
            - id: Customer ID
            - store: Hardcoded as 'ecommerce' to indicate the source
            - email: Customer's email address
            - zip_code: ZIP code extracted using `get_json_object(addresses, '$[0].zip')`
            - street: Address street extracted using `get_json_object(addresses, '$[0].address1')`
            - city: City name extracted using `get_json_object(addresses, '$[0].city')`
            - country: Country name extracted using `get_json_object(addresses, '$[0].country')`
          source_table: ecommerce_customers

    - step: 2
      description: >
        Create a CTE named `subscriptions_orders` that retrieves customer information
        from `subscriptions_accounts` and `subscriptions_invoices` tables.
      details:
        - name: subscriptions_orders
          purpose: >
            Combines data from `subscriptions_accounts` and `subscriptions_invoices`
            tables to extract customer details such as ID, email, and address information
            (zip code, street, city, country) using JSON notation.
          fields_extracted:
            - id: Account code as ID
            - store: Hardcoded as 'subscriptions' to indicate the source
            - email: Customer's email address
            - zip_code: Postal code extracted from `b.address:postal_code`
            - street: Street address extracted from `b.address:street1`
            - city: City extracted from `b.address:city`
            - country: Country extracted from `b.address:country`
          source_tables:
            - subscriptions_accounts
            - subscriptions_invoices

    - step: 3
      description: >
        Create a final CTE named `sales_customers` that combines the results of
        `ecommerce_orders` and `subscriptions_orders`.
      details:
        - name: sales_customers
          purpose: >
            Combines customer data from both `ecommerce_orders` and `subscriptions_orders`
            CTEs into a single dataset.
          fields_combined:
            - id: Customer ID
            - store: Source of the order ('ecommerce' or 'subscriptions')
            - email: Customer's email address
            - zip_code: Combined ZIP code information
            - street: Combined street address information
            - city: Combined city information
            - country: Combined country information
          combined_from_ctes:
            - ecommerce_orders
            - subscriptions_orders

    - step: 4
      description: >
        Execute a final SELECT statement to retrieve all columns from the `sales_customers`
        CTE, effectively combining all customer data from both ecommerce and subscriptions.
      details:
        - purpose: Retrieve all columns from the `sales_customers` CTE.
        - source_cte: sales_customers
