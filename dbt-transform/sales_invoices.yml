    This YAML file provides an explanation of the SQL code that combines payment
    information from ecommerce and subscriptions invoices.
  steps:
    - step: 1
      description: >
        Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `ecommerce_payments` that retrieves
        transaction and invoice IDs from the `ecommerce_transactions` table.
      details:
        - name: ecommerce_payments
          purpose: >
            Extracts transaction and invoice IDs from the `ecommerce_transactions` table.
          fields_extracted:
            - transaction_id: Transaction ID from `id` column
            - invoice_id: Invoice ID from `receipt:id` column
          source_table: ecommerce_transactions

    - step: 2
      description: >
        Create a CTE named `subscriptions_payments` that retrieves transaction and
        invoice IDs from `subscriptions_invoices` table, filtering out NULL transactions.
      details:
        - name: subscriptions_payments
          purpose: >
            Extracts transaction and invoice IDs from `subscriptions_invoices` table,
            filtering rows where the transaction ID is not NULL.
          fields_extracted:
            - transaction_id: Transaction ID extracted using `get_json_object(transactions, '$[0].id')`
            - invoice_id: Invoice ID from `id` column
          source_table: subscriptions_invoices

    - step: 3
      description: >
        Create a final CTE named `sales_payment_invoices` that combines the results of
        `ecommerce_payments` and `subscriptions_payments`.
      details:
        - name: sales_payment_invoices
          purpose: >
            Combines payment information from both `ecommerce_payments` and `subscriptions_payments`
            CTEs into a single dataset.
          fields_combined: "* (All columns)"
          combined_from_ctes:
            - ecommerce_payments
            - subscriptions_payments

    - step: 4
      description: >
        Execute a final SELECT statement to retrieve all columns from the `sales_payment_invoices`
        CTE, effectively combining all payment information from both ecommerce and subscriptions.
      details:
        - purpose: Retrieve all columns from the `sales_payment_invoices` CTE.
        - source_cte: sales_payment_invoices
